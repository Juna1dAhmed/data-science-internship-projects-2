## ðŸ§  Task 2 â€“ Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)

**Objective:**  
Cluster mall customers based on annual income and spending score using **K-Means Clustering**, and propose targeted marketing strategies.

**Tech Used:**  
- K-Means
- PCA (for visualization)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Marketing Strategy Added:**
- **Segment 0 â€“ High Income, High Spending**: Loyalty programs, premium offers
- **Segment 1 â€“ Low Income, Low Spending**: Discount bundles, coupons
- **Segment 2 â€“ Young, Mid-Spenders**: Flash sales, app promotions

## âš¡ Task 3 â€“ Energy Consumption Forecasting

**Objective:**  
Forecast short-term household power usage using time-based patterns.

**Tech Used:**  
- ARIMA
- Facebook Prophet
- XGBoost
- Feature engineering (hour of day, weekday)
- MAE, RMSE evaluation

**Conclusion:**  
Prophet provided consistent trends with interpretable seasonality. Insights help energy providers predict and optimize usage.

## ðŸ’° Task 4 â€“ Loan Default Risk with Business Cost Optimization

**Objective:**  
Predict loan default and minimize business cost by optimizing classification threshold.

**Tech Used:**  
- CatBoost Classifier
- Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
- Cost function modeling (False Positives & False Negatives)
- Threshold tuning to minimize total cost

**Conclusion:**  
Tuning the threshold reduced total misclassification cost. Valuable for high-risk lending environments.
